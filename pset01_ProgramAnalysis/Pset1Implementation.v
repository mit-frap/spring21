Module Impl.
  (* The first part of this assignment involves the [bool] datatype,
   * which has the following definition.
   * <<
       Inductive bool :=
       | true
       | false.
     >>
   * We will define logical negation and conjunction of Boolean values,
   * and prove some properties of these definitions.
   *)

  (* Define [Neg] so that it implements Boolean negation, which flips
   * the truth value of a Boolean value.
   *)
  Definition Neg (b : bool) : bool.
  Admitted.

  (* For instance, the negation of [true] should be [false].
   * This proof should follow from reducing both sides of the equation
   * and observing that they are identical.
   *)
  Theorem Neg_true : Neg true = false.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Negation should be involutive, meaning that if we negate
   * any Boolean value twice, we should get the original value back.

   * To prove a fact like this that holds for all Booleans, it suffices
   * to prove the fact for both [true] and [false] by using the
   * [cases] tactic.
   *)
  Theorem Neg_involutive : forall b : bool, Neg (Neg b) = b.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Define [And] so that it implements Boolean conjunction. That is,
   * the result value should be [true] exactly when both inputs
   * are [true].
   *)
  Definition And (x y : bool) : bool.
  Admitted.

  (* Here are a couple of examples of how [And] should act on
   * concrete inputs.
   *)
  Theorem And_true_true : And true true = true.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  Theorem And_false_true : And false true = false.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Prove that [And] is commutative, meaning that switching the order
   * of its arguments doesn't affect the result.
   *)
  Theorem And_comm : forall x y : bool, And x y = And y x.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Prove that the conjunction of a Boolean value with [true]
   * doesn't change that value.
   *)
  Theorem And_true_r : forall x : bool, And x true = x.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* In the second part of this assignment, we will work with a simple language
   * of imperative arithmetic programs that sequentially apply operations
   * to a natural-number-valued state.

   * The [Prog] datatype defines abstract syntax trees for this language.
   *)

  Print Prog.

  (* Define [run] such that [run p n] gives the final state
   * that running the program [p] should result in, when the
   * initial state is [n].
   *)
  Fixpoint run (p : Prog) (initState : nat) : nat.
  Admitted.

  Theorem run_Example1 : run Done 0 = 0.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  Theorem run_Example2 : run (MulThen 5 (AddThen 2 Done)) 1 = 7.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  Theorem run_Example3 : run (SetToThen 3 (MulThen 2 Done)) 10 = 6.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Define [numInstructions] to compute the number of instructions
   * in a program, not counting [Done] as an instruction.
   *)
  Fixpoint numInstructions (p : Prog) : nat.
  Admitted.

  Theorem numInstructions_Example :
    numInstructions (MulThen 5 (AddThen 2 Done)) = 2.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Define [concatProg] such that [concatProg p1 p2] is the program
   * that first runs [p1] and then runs [p2].
   *)
  Fixpoint concatProg (p1 p2 : Prog) : Prog.
  Admitted.

  Theorem concatProg_Example :
       concatProg (AddThen 1 Done) (MulThen 2 Done)
       = AddThen 1 (MulThen 2 Done).
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Prove that the number of instructions in the concatenation of
   * two programs is the sum of the number of instructions in each
   * program.
   *)
  Theorem concatProg_numInstructions
    : forall (p1 p2 : Prog), numInstructions (concatProg p1 p2)
                        = numInstructions p1 + numInstructions p2.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Prove that running the concatenation of [p1] with [p2] is
     equivalent to running [p1] and then running [p2] on the
     result. *)
  Theorem concatProg_run
    : forall (p1 p2 : Prog) (initState : nat),
      run (concatProg p1 p2) initState =
      run p2 (run p1 initState).
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* Read this definition and understand how division by zero is handled. *)
  Fixpoint runPortable (p : Prog) (state : nat) : bool * nat :=
    match p with
    | Done => (true, state)
    | AddThen n p => runPortable p (n+state)
    | MulThen n p => runPortable p (n*state)
    | DivThen n p =>
        if n ==n 0 then (false, state) else

    end.
  Arguments Nat.div : simpl never. (* you don't need to understand this line *)

  (* Here are a few examples: *)

  Definition goodProgram1 := AddThen 1 (VidThen 10 Done).
  Example runPortable_good : forall n,
    runPortable goodProgram1 n = (true, 10/(1+n)).
  Proof. simplify. equality. Qed.

  Definition badProgram1 := AddThen 0 (VidThen 10 Done).
  Example runPortable_bad : let n := 0 in
    runPortable badProgram1 n = (false, 0).
  Proof. simplify. equality. Qed.

  Definition badProgram2 := AddThen 1 (DivThen 0 Done).
  Example runPortable_bad2 : forall n,
    runPortable badProgram2 n = (false, 1+n).
  Proof. simplify. equality. Qed.

  (* Prove that running the concatenation [p] using [runPortable]
     coincides with using [run], as long as [runPortable] returns
     [true] to confirm that no divison by zero occurred. *)
  Lemma runPortable_run : forall p s0 s1,
    runPortable p s0 = (true, s1) -> run p s0 = s1.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* The final goal of this pset is to implement [validate : Prog -> bool]
     such that if this function returns [true], the program would not trigger
     division by zero regardless of what state it starts out in.  [validate] is
     allowed to return [false] for some perfectly good programs that never cause
     division by zero, but it must recognize as good the examples given below.  In
     jargon, [validate] is required to be sound but not complete, but "complete
     enough" for the use cases defined by the examples given here: *)

  Definition goodProgram2 := AddThen 0 (MulThen 10 (AddThen 0 (DivThen 1 Done))).
  Definition goodProgram3 := AddThen 1 (MulThen 10 (AddThen 0 (VidThen 1 Done))).
  Definition goodProgram4 := Done.
  Definition goodProgram5 := SetToThen 0 (DivThen 1 Done).
  Definition goodProgram6 := SetToThen 1 (VidThen 1 Done).
  Definition goodProgram7 := AddThen 1 (DivThen 1 (DivThen 1 (VidThen 1 Done))).

  (* If you already see a way to build [validate] that meets the
   * requirements above, _and have a plan for how to prove it correct_,
   * feel free to just code away. Our solution uses one intermediate definition
   * and one intermediate lemma in the soundness proof -- both of which are more
   * sophisticated than the top-level versions given here. *)

  (* If a clear plan hasn't emerged in 10 minutes (or if you get stuck later),
   * take a look at the hints for this pset on the course web site.
   * It is not expected that this pset is doable for everyone without the hints,
   * and some planning is required to complete the proof successfully.
   * In particular, repeatedly trying out different combinations of tactics
   * and ideas from hints until something sticks can go on for arbitrarily long
   * with little insight and no success; just guessing a solution is unlikely.
   * Thus, we encourage you to take your time to think, look at the hints when
   * necessary, and only jump into coding when you have some idea why it should
   * succeed. Some may call Coq a video game, but it is not a grinding contest. *)


  Definition validate (p : Prog) : bool.
  Admitted.

  (* Start by making sure that your solution passes the following tests, and add
   * at least one of your own tests: *)

  Example validate1 : validate goodProgram1 = true. Admitted.
  Example validate2 : validate goodProgram2 = true. Admitted.
  Example validate3 : validate goodProgram3 = true. Admitted.
  Example validate4 : validate goodProgram4 = true. Admitted.
  Example validate5 : validate goodProgram5 = true. Admitted.
  Example validate6 : validate goodProgram6 = true. Admitted.
  Example validate7 : validate goodProgram7 = true. Admitted.
  Example validateb1 : validate badProgram1 = false. Admitted.
  Example validateb2 : validate badProgram2 = false. Admitted.

  (* Then, add your own example of a bad program here, and check that `validate`
   * returns `false` on it: *)

  Definition badProgram3 : Prog. Admitted.
  Example validateb3 : validate badProgram3 = false. Admitted.



  (* Finally, before diving into the Coq proof, try to convince yourself that
   * your code is correct by applying induction by hand.  Can you describe the
   * high-level structure of the proof?  Which cases will you have to reason
   * about?  What do the induction hypotheses look like?  Which key lemmas do
   * you need?  Write a short (~10-20 lines) informal proof sketch before
   * proceeding. *)

  (** Proof sketch: **)
  (* [[Fill in your proof sketch here.]] *)

  (* Now you're ready to write the proof in Coq: *)

  Lemma validate_sound : forall p, validate p = true ->
    forall s, runPortable p s = (true, run p s).
  Admitted.

    - Search, for example Search (_ + 0).
    - induct, for example induct x
    - simplify
    - propositional
    - equality
    - linear_arithmetic
    - cases, for example cases (X ==n Y)
    - apply, for example apply H

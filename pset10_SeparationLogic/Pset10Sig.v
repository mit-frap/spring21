(* Something very subtle happened in that loop: we iterated using a pointer into
 * *the interior of a struct*, in each branch of the last [if]!  This is a fun
 * example of the kinds of tricks that can be played in a low-level language,
 * and the verification techniques are up to the challenge. *)


(* Your task: verify the two methods.  (By the way, our solution also includes a
 * soundness proof for this logic, but we aren't asking you to write one.)
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * The difficulty of this problem set is scoped assuming you will use the
 * tactics included in this file, which are very similar to the ones from
 * Lecture 20!  Trying to attack these proofs from first principles will likely
 * lead to proof size spiraling out of control.  The main ingredients you should
 * expect to reuse are:
 *  - [step]: A tactic to choose the right Hoare-logic rule to apply next, when
 *    your goal is a Hoare triple
 *  - [cancel]: A tactic to prove an implication between two separation-logic
 *    assertions, or reduce it to a simpler implication by *cancel*ing matching
 *    subformulas; before calling [cancel], be sure you have marked [Opaque]
 *    all of the predicates standing for data structures!  There is a commented-
 *    out [Opaque mtree] command in Pset9.v for precisely this reason; don't
 *    forget to uncomment it, with any lemmas about this predicate proved
 *    beforehand.
 *  - [heq]: A tactic to reduce a separation-logic assertion implication (using
 *    [===]) to two implications (using [===>])
 *  - [loop_inv P0 Q0]: A tactic to apply the loop rule, given an invariant
 *    split in a peculiar way; see above for an example
 *  - [setoid_rewrite H]: A tactic to rewrite within a separation-logic
 *    implication, using an equivalence that applies to one of its subterms
 *
 * Our solution also has a few direct uses of rules [HtConsequence] and
 * [HtFrame], sometimes using the [with] syntax of [apply] to specify values
 * for some variables that appear in these rules' statements. In particular,
 * you can use [HtConsequence] before [HtFrame] to ensure that the predicate
 * that you want to frame out is in the desired syntactic position so that
 * [HtFrame] will apply. The [exis_right] lemma will also be handy, as used
 * in the example above. *)
Module Type S.
  (* Confirm that [lookup] has no memory errors and that [p] still points to
   * some binary tree once [lookup] has completed. Note that this theorem is
   * very similar to [llength_ok]. We encourage you to adapt that proof to
   * this one.

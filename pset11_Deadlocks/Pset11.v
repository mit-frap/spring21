(** * 6.822 Formal Reasoning About Programs, Spring 2021 - Pset 11 *)

Require Import Frap Pset11Sig.

(* Programmers who start programming with threads and locks soon realize that it
 * is tricky to avoid *deadlocks*, where thread #1 is waiting to take a lock
 * held by thread #2, and thread #2 is waiting to take a lock held by thread #3,
 * and... thread #N is waiting to take a lock held by thread #1.  That's a wait
 * cycle, and none of the threads will ever make progress.
 *
 * The most common wisdom about avoiding deadlocks is to impose a *total order*
 * on the locks.  A thread is only allowed to acquire a lock that is *less than*
 * all locks it currently holds.  In this pset, we formalize a simple static
 * analysis checking that the total-order rule is obeyed, and we prove that any
 * program accepted by the analysis avoids deadlock. *)

(* Please start by reading the definitions in Pset11Sig.v! *)

(* Before diving into the proof hacking, it might be helpful to write a short
   sample program (in Coq) where thread 1 acquires lock 1 and then lock 2,
   while thread 2 tries to acquire lock 2 and then lock 1, and explain (in
   English) how a deadlock can happen: *)

Example bad: prog. Admitted.

(* FILL IN explanation here *)


(* And now, explain why the total-order rule would reject your example by copy-pasting
   the one rule which rejects it from Pset11Sig.v and briefly describing how it would
   reject it: *)

(* FILL IN explanation here *)

(* The two questions above are not graded, but we hope they help you understand
   the material better! *)

(* Since we use the [a_useful_invariant] theorem, proving [deadlock_freedom]
   reduces to proving this lemma â€” the only one in this Pset!  See hints.md if
   you get stuck, and of course come to office hours if you have any questions
   or need help. *)



Module Impl.
Lemma deadlock_freedom' :
  forall (h : heap) (p : prog'),
  Forall (fun l_c : locks * cmd => goodCitizen (fst l_c) (snd l_c) { }) p ->
  Forall finished (progOf p) \/ (exists h_l_p' : heap * locks * prog,
                                    step (h, locksOf p, progOf p) h_l_p').
Proof.
Admitted.

(* Here's how we can use [a_useful_invariant] to go from [deadlock_freedom'] to
   [deadlock_freedom]: *)
Theorem deadlock_freedom :
  forall h p,
    Forall (fun c => goodCitizen {} c {}) p ->
    invariantFor (trsys_of h {} p) (fun h_l_p =>
                                      let '(_, _, p') := h_l_p in
                                      Forall finished p'
                                      \/ exists h_l_p', step h_l_p h_l_p').
Proof.
  (* To begin with, we strengthen the invariant to the one proved in Pset11Sig. *)
  simplify.
  eapply invariant_weaken.
  eauto using a_useful_invariant.

  (* What's left is to prove that this invariant implies deadlock-freedom. *)
  first_order.
  destruct s as [[h' ls] p'].
  invert H0.

  (* We don't actually need to use the [disjointLocks] property.  It was only
   * important in strengthening the induction to prove that other invariant. *)
  clear H6.

  (* At this point, we apply the lemma that we expect you to prove! *)
  apply deadlock_freedom'. assumption.
Qed.
